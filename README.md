# DATA
Data is the collection of different numbers, symbols, and alphabets to represent information.

# DATA STRUCTURE
A data structure is a group of data elements that provides the easiest way to store and perform different actions on the data of the computer. 
* A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks. 

# ALGORITHM
The word Algorithm means "A  set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations" Or "A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently by recursive operations". 

# PROPERTIES OF ALGORITHM
* It should terminate after a finite time.
* It should produce at least one output.
* It should take zero or more input.
* It should be deterministic means giving the same output for the same input case.
* Every step in the algorithm must be effective i.e. every step should do some work.

# How to Design an Algorithm?
In order to write an algorithm, the following things are needed as a pre-requisite: <br>
 
1) The problem that is to be solved by this algorithm i.e. clear problem definition.
2) The constraints of the problem must be considered while solving the problem.
3) The input to be taken to solve the problem.
4) The output to be expected when the problem is solved.
5) The solution to this problem, is within the given constraints.
