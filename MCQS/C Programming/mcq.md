Q1:-
```
#include "stdio.h"
int main() 
{ 
    int x, y = 5, z = 5; 
    x = y == z; 
    printf("%d", x); 
    getchar(); 
    return 0; 
}
```
Output- 1<br>

Q2:-
```
#include <stdio.h>
// Assume base address of "GeeksQuiz" to be 1000
int main()
{
   printf(5 + "GeeksQuiz");
   return 0;
}
```
Output- Quiz <br>

Q3:-
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int i = 3;
    printf("%d", (++i)++);
    return 0;
}
```
Output- Compilation Error because in C, prefix and postfix operators need l-value to perform operation and return r-value. The expression (++i)++ when executed increments the value of variable i(i is a l-value) and returns r-value. The compiler generates the error(l-value required) when it tries to post-incremeny the value of a r-value. <br>

Q4:-
```
#include <stdio.h>
#if X == 3
    #define Y 3
#else
    #define Y 5
#endif
 
int main()
{
    printf("%d", Y);
    return 0;
}
```
Output- 5 <br>

Q5:-
```
struct { 
    short s[5]; //takes 2*5 = 10 bytes
    union { 
         float y; //takes 4 bytes
         long z; //takes 8bytes
    }u; 
} t; //takes 10+8 = 18bytes
```
Output- 18 <br>

Q6:-
```
In C, parameters are always 
```
Output- Passed by Value <br>

Q7:-

```
Output- Volatile <br>

Q9:-
```
Which of the following is not a logical operator?
```
Output- | <br>

Q10:-
```
Which file is generated after pre-processing of a C program?
```
Output- .i <br>

Q11:-
```
In C, static storage class cannot be used with:
```
Output- Function parameter <br>

Q12:- In below program, what would you put in place of “?” to print “Quiz”?
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() 
{ 
  char arr[] = "GeeksQuiz"; 
  printf("%s", ?); 
  return 0; 
}
```
Output- (arr+5) <br>

Q13:-
```
Which of the following is true about arrays in C. 
```
Output- For every type T except void and function type, there can be an array of T. <br>

Q14:-
```
What output will be generated by the given code dsegment if: 
Line 1 is replaced by “auto int a = 1;” 
Line 2 is replaced by “register int a = 2;”
```
Output- 4 2, 4 2, 2 0 <br>

Q15:-
```
Which of the following is true
```
Output- gets() doesn't do any array bound testing and should not be used. <br> 

Q16:-
```
Which of the following operators can be applied on structure variables?
```
Output- Assignment ( = ) <br>

Q17:-
```
What is the use of "#pragma once"?
```
Output- Used in a header file to avoid its inclusion more than once. <br>

Q18:- What does the following C statement mean? 
```

```
Output- Read maximum 4 characters from console. <br>

Q19:- Assume that a character takes 1 byte. Output of following program? 
```
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char str[20] = "GeeksQuiz";
    printf ("%d", sizeof(str));
    return 0;
}
```
Output- 20 <br>

Q20:- Predict the output of following program, assume that a character takes 1 byte and pointer takes 4 bytes.
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char *str1 = "GeeksQuiz";
    char str2[] = "GeeksQuiz";
 
    printf("sizeof(str1) = %d, sizeof(str2) = %d", sizeof(str1), sizeof(str2));
    return 0;
}
```
Output- sizeof(str1) = 4, sizeof(str2) = 10 <br>
